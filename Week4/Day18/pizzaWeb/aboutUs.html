                <p>Founded in 1998, our pizza place began with a simple idea: to bring authentic, mouth-watering Italian pizzas to our local community. Our journey started in a small, cozy corner of the neighborhood, where our founder, Mario Rossi, combined traditional family recipes with fresh, locally sourced ingredients. Over the years, our passion for creating delicious, high-quality pizzas has turned us into a beloved spot for pizza lovers far and wide.</p>
