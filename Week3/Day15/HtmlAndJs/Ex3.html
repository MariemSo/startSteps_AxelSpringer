<!-- Introducing Simple JavaScript Functionality:
! Exercise 3: Calculating the Sum of Two Numbers:
    - Modify your HTML document to include two input fields (using <input> elements) for entering numbers and a button (using <button>) labeled 
    "Calculate Sum".
    - Write a JavaScript function that retrieves the values entered in the input fields, calculates their sum, and displays the result.
    - Add an event listener to the button element so that when it is clicked, the JavaScript function is executed.
    Test the functionality by entering numbers into the input fields and clicking the button to see the sum displayed.
! Exercise 4: Generating a Random Number:
    - Update your HTML document to include a button labeled "Generate Random Number" and a paragraph element where the random number will be displayed.
    - Write a JavaScript function that generates a random number using the Math.random() method and displays it in the designated paragraph.
    - Add an event listener to the button element so that when it is clicked, the JavaScript function is executed.
    Test the functionality by clicking the button to generate a random number and verify that it changes with each click.
! Exercise 5: Your Choice:
    - Choose a simple JavaScript functionality that interests you or aligns with your learning goals (e.g., displaying a current date/time, 
    toggling visibility of an element, validating a form input).
    - Implement the chosen functionality in your HTML document using JavaScript.
    Test the functionality to ensure it works as expected. -->
