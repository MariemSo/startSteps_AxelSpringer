<!--! HTML Basics:
    Exercise 2: Creating a Basic HTML Document:
    Write the HTML code to create a basic webpage structure.
    Include the following elements: <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body>.
    Write a simple message (e.g., "Hello, World!") inside the <body> tags.
    Test the HTML document by opening it in a web browser. 
<!--! Exercise 3: Formatting Text with HTML:
-Write HTML code to create a paragraph (`<p>`) element containing a short paragraph of text.
-Use HTML tags such as `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<u>`, and `<span>` to format specific parts of the text 
(e.g., making some words bold, italicized, underlined, or colored). 
- Experiment with different formatting options and observe the changes in the rendered text when viewed in a web browser. -->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>And welcome to your first HTML document. This is a simple paragraph to demonstrate the basic structure 
        of an HTML page.</p>
        <p>this is a list of some Html tags ,the one used to list it is made by an "ul" tag short for unordered list </p>
        <p>inside of the "ul" tag we use the "li" tag for each list item </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                the word <strong>HTML</strong> is written in a tag called strong.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>EM</em> is being emphasized by the tag "em" , it is now italic .
            </li>
            <li>
                we can also use <span style="color:rgb(38, 143, 80)">span</span> element to colors a part of a text
            </li>
            <li>
                if we want to <u>underline</u> a text we use the "u" tag
            </li>


        </ul>
